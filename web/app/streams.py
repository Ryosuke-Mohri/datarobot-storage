"""Lightweight in-memory publisher for chat Server-Sent Events.

The intent is to keep the infrastructure footprint small while we stay on a single
FastAPI/Uvicorn worker. Each chat gets a set of subscribers (per browser tab) and
we fan out message events to all of them. We keep a modest queue per subscriber so
one stalled client cannot consume unbounded memory, and we close the stream after a
fixed heartbeat window so zombie connections don't accumulate forever.

This module is intentionally simple: no external broker, no persistence, just
enough guardrails to be safe up to a few hundred concurrent listeners.
