## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

If you are using DataRobot Codespaces, this is already complete for you. If not, install the following tools:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (3.11+ required for infrastructure and backend development)
- [Taskfile.dev](https://taskfile.dev/#/installation) (task runner)
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) (Python package manager)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (JavaScript runtime for frontend development)
- [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/download-install/) (infrastructure as code)

##### DataRobot Codespaces Setup

If you are developing within a DataRobot codespaces, in order to test from the codespace the development ports need to be exposed. You can check this in the "Exposed Ports" section of your "Session Environment" tab (pictured below). You should have the ports 5173 (frontend), 8080 (application server) and 8842 (agent server) exposed. This should have been automatically enabled if you created this application template from the gallery, otherwise (e.g. if cloned) configure these ports manually. There will be a link next to the port to a URL where the service can be accessed when running locally in the codespace.

#### Example Installation Commands

For the latest and most accurate installation instructions for your platform, visit:

- https://www.python.org/downloads/
- https://taskfile.dev/installation/
- https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/
- https://nodejs.org/en/download/
- https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/download-install/

We provide the instructions below to save you a context flip, but your system may not meet the common expectations from these shortcut scripts:

**macOS:**

```sh
brew install python
brew install go-task/tap/go-task
brew install uv
brew install node
brew install pulumi/tap/pulumi
```

**Linux (Debian/Ubuntu/DataRobot Codespaces):**

```sh
# Python
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip python3-venv
# Taskfile.dev
sh -c "$(curl --location https://taskfile.dev/install.sh)" -- -d -b ~/.local/bin
# uv
curl -Ls https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
# Node.js
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_lts.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
# Pulumi
curl -fsSL https://get.pulumi.com | sh
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
# Python
winget install --id=Python.Python.3.12 -e
# Taskfile.dev
winget install --id=Task.Task -e
# uv
winget install --id=astral-sh.uv  -e
# Node.js
winget install --id=OpenJS.NodeJS -e
# Pulumi
winget install pulumi
winget upgrade pulumi
# Windows Developer Tools
winget install Microsoft.VisualStudio.2022.BuildTools --force --override "--wait --passive --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.VC.Tools.x86.x64 --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.Windows11SDK.22621"

# For Windows 10/11, toggle Developer Mode to "On" under System > For developer to enable symbolic link
# Additionally, we use symlinks in the repo. Please set
git config --global core.symlink true
# Alternatively, you can do it for just this repo by omitting the --global and running this in the repo.
```

### Pulumi Login

Pulumi requires a location to store the state of the application template. The easiest option is to
run:

```
pulumi login --local
```

We recommend using a shared backend like Ceph, Minio, S3, or Azure Blob Storage. See
[Managing Pulumi State and Backends](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/concepts/state-and-backends/) for
more details. For production CI/CD information see our comprehensive
[CI/CD Guide for Application Templates](https://docs.datarobot.com/en/docs/workbench/wb-apps/app-templates/pulumi-tasks/cicd-tutorial.html)

### Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/datarobot-community/talk-to-my-docs-agents
cd talk-to-my-docs-agents
```

### Environment Setup

Copy the sample environment file and fill in your credentials:

```sh
cp .env.template .env
# Edit .env with your API keys and secrets
```

The `task` commands will automatically read the `.env` file directly to ensure each task gets the correct configuration.
If you need to source those variables directly into your shell you can:

**Linux/macOS:**

```sh
set -a && source .env && set +a
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
Get-Content .env | ForEach-Object {
	if ($_ -match '^\s*([^#][^=]*)=(.*)$') {
		[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable($matches[1], $matches[2])
	}
}
```

---

## Development Workflow

All subprojects use [Taskfile.dev](https://taskfile.dev/#/installation) for common tasks. See each subproject’s README for details.

### Getting Started

To get started, run:

```sh
task install-all
task infra:deploy-dev
```

This will install all dependencies for each component, and deploy the backend LLM which sets you up
for local/Codespace development.

To get running the three components that run locally, the agent, backend web, and frontend Web server
you can run the single command:

```sh
task dev-all
```

And if you want to work on each one separately, you'll want to run them on their own:

#### Running the Agent Locally

```sh
task agent:dev
```

#### Running the Frontend

```sh
task frontend:dev
```

#### Running the Backend

```sh
task web:dev-agent
```

Running the Web backend with a deployed Agent:

```sh
task web:dev
```

---

## Deployment

Infrastructure is managed with Pulumi. To deploy:

```sh
task infra:deploy
```

Or, for manual control:

```sh
set -a && source .env && set +a
cd infra
uv run pulumi stack init <your-stack-name>
uv run pulumi up
```

There are also several shortcut tasks in that `task infra:` component such as only
deploying the backing LLM, getting stack info, or changing your stack if you have multiple stacks.

---

## Architecture Overview

This template is organized into modular components:

- **agent_retrieval_agent/**: Multi-agent orchestration and core agent logic using CrewAI for complex processing and capabilities with you documents ([README](agent_retrieval_agent/README.md))
- **core/**: Shared Python core logic ([README](core/README.md))
- **frontend_web/**: React + Vite web frontend ([README](frontend_web/README.md))
- **web/**: FastAPI backend ([README](web/README.md))
- **infra/**: Pulumi infrastructure-as-code

![Architectural Diagram](_docs/static/img/architectural-diagram.png)

Each component can be developed and deployed independently or as part of the full stack.

---

## Change the LLM

Talk to My Docs supports multiple flexible LLM options including:

- LLM Blueprint with LLM Gateway (default)
- LLM Blueprint with an External LLM
- Registered model such as an NVIDIA NIM
- Already Deployed Text Generation model in DataRobot

### LLM Configuration Recommended Option

You can edit the LLM configuration by manually changing which configuration is active.
Simply run:

```sh
ln -sf ../configurations/<chosen_configuration> infra/infra/llm.py
```

After doing so, you'll likely want to edit the llm.py to have the correct model selected. Particularly
for non-LLM Gateway options.

### LLM Configuration Alternative Option

If you want to do it dynamically, you can set it as a configuration value with:

```sh
INFRA_ENABLE_LLM=<chosen_configuration>
```

from the list of options in the `infra/configurations/llm` folder.

Here are some examples of each configuration using the dynamic option described above:

#### LLM Blueprint with LLM Gateway (default)

Default option is LLM Blueprint with LLM Gateway if not specified in your `.env` file.

```sh
INFRA_ENABLE_LLM=blueprint_with_llm_gateway.py
```

#### Existing LLM Deployment in DataRobot

Uncomment and configure these in your `.env` file:

```sh
TEXTGEN_DEPLOYMENT_ID=<your_deployment_id>
INFRA_ENABLE_LLM=deployed_llm.py
```

#### Registered Model with LLM Blueprint

Like an NVIDIA NIM. This also shows how you can adjust the timeout in case getting a GPU takes a long time:

```sh
DATAROBOT_TIMEOUT_MINUTES=120
TEXTGEN_REGISTERED_MODEL_ID='<Your Registered Model ID>'
INFRA_ENABLE_LLM=registered_model.py
```

#### External LLM Provider

Configure an LLM with an external LLM provider like Azure, Bedrock, Anthropic, or VertexAI. Here's an Azure AI example:

```sh
INFRA_ENABLE_LLM=blueprint_with_external_llm.py
LLM_DEFAULT_MODEL="azure/gpt-4o"
OPENAI_API_VERSION='2024-08-01-preview'
OPENAI_API_BASE='https://<your_custom_endpoint>.openai.azure.com'
OPENAI_API_DEPLOYMENT_ID='<your deployment_id>'
OPENAI_API_KEY='<your_api_key>'
```

See the [DataRobot documentation](https://docs.datarobot.com/en/docs/gen-ai/playground-tools/deploy-llm.html) for details on other providers.

In addition to the changes for the `.env` file, you can also edit the respective llm.py file to make additional changes
such as the default LLM, temperature, top_p, etc within the chosen configuration

---

## Web Configuration

The Web component is one of the more complex components and requires
additional configuration such as setting up a SQLAlchemy asyncio
compatible [database](web/README.md#database-configuration) and [OAuth
providers](web/README.md#oauth-applications) to integrate documents
from third-party document stores

---

## OAuth Applications

The template can work with files stored in Google Drive and Box.
In order to give it access to those files, you need to configure OAuth Applications.

### Google OAuth Application

- Go to [Google API Console](https://console.developers.google.com/) from your Google account
- Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Enabled APIs & services" > "Enable APIs and services" search for Drive, and add it.
- Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "OAuth consent screen" and make sure you have your consent screen configured. You may have both "External" and "Internal" audience types.
- Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials" and click on the "Create Credentials" button. Select "OAuth client ID".
- Select "Web application" as Application type, fill in "Name" & "Authorized redirect URIs" fields. For example, for local development, the redirect URL will be:
  - `http://localhost:5173/oauth/callback` - local vite dev server (used by frontend folks)
  - `http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback` - web-proxied frontend
  - `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/oauth/callback/` - the local web API (optional).
  - For production, you'll want to add your DataRobot callback URL. For example, in US Prod it is `https://app.datarobot.com/custom_applications/{appId}/oauth/callback`. For any installation of DataRobot it is `https://<datarobot-endpoint>/custom_applications/{appId}/oauth/callback`.
- Hit the "Create" button when you are done.
- Copy the "Client ID" and "Client Secret" values from the created OAuth client ID and set them in the template env variables as `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` correspondingly.
- Make sure you have the "Google Drive API" enabled in the "APIs & Services" > "Library" section. Otherwise, you will get 403 errors.
- Finally, go to "APIs & Services" > "OAuth consent screen" > "Data Access" and make sure you have the following scopes selected:
  - `openid`
  - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email`
  - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile`
  - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly`

### Box OAuth Application

- Head to [Box Developer Console](https://app.box.com/developers/console) from your Box account
- Create a new platform application, then select "Custom App" type
- Fill in "Application Name" and select "Purpose" (e.g. "Integration"). Then, fill in three more info fields. The actual selection doesn't matter.
- Select "User Authentication (OAuth 2.0)" as Authentication Method and click on the "Create App" button
- In the "OAuth 2.0 Redirect URIs" section, please fill in callback URLs you want to use.
  - `http://localhost:5173/oauth/callback` - local vite dev server (used by frontend folks)
  - `http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback` - web-proxied frontend
  - `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/oauth/callback/` - the local web API (optional).
  - For production, you'll want to add your DataRobot callback URL. For example, in US Prod it is `https://app.datarobot.com/custom_applications/{appId}/oauth/callback`.
- Hit "Save Changes" after that.
- Under the "Application Scopes", please make sure you have both `Read all files and folders stored in Box` and "Write all files and folders store in Box" checkboxes selected. We need both because we need to "write" to the log that we've downloaded the selected files.
- Finally, under the "OAuth 2.0 Credentials" section, you should be able to find your Client ID and Client Secret pair to setup in the template env variables as `BOX_CLIENT_ID` and `BOX_CLIENT_SECRET` correspondingly.

After you've set those in your project `.env` file, on the next Pulumi Up, we'll create OAuth
providers in your DataRobot installation. To view and manage those and verify they are working
navigate to `<your_datarobot_url>/account/oauth-providers` or in US production: https://app.datarobot.com/account/oauth-providers.

Additionally, the Pulumi output variables get used to populate those providers for your Codespace and
local development environment as well.

- [Agent Retrieval Agent](agent_retrieval_agent/README.md)
- [Core](core/README.md)
- [Frontend Web](frontend_web/README.md)
- [Web (FastAPI)](web/README.md)

---

## Advanced Usage

- Customize environment variables in `.env`
- Extend agents or add new tools in `agent_retrieval_agent/`
- Add or modify frontend components in `frontend_web/`
- Update infrastructure in `infra/`

---

## Using DR cli

Instead of editing `.env` file you can use wizard provided by `dr` cli command to set or update environment variables.

It is preinstalled in DataRobot Codespaces.
For other environments you can get it [here](https://github.com/datarobot-oss/cli/releases).

To start a wizard, run:

```sh
dr dotenv setup
```

It will provide DataRobot credentials automatically and ask for additional info like pulumi passphrase, data source and respective API keys and secrets, etc.

At the end you can review all env variables and edit them or restart wizard with answered questions already filled in.
